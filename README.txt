PROJECT : TO DETECT PHISHING WEBSITES BASED ON URLs. 
************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:
*****************************************************************************************
This is a Web based project to detect Phishing websites based on the URLs.
Every website or a webpage has a URL. So based on URL we can determine whether a webpage or website is a Phishing Website or a Legitimate Website
Each and Every URL has some features
1.URLs and Domain Features
2.Address Bar features
3.Security and Encryption features  
Based on these features we can determine whether a website is phishing website or not.
Example : 1. www.paytm.com is a real website
          2. www.pay-tm.com is a fake website
Reason:Based on URL and Domain features special characters('-' in the above example) are not allowed in the Domain part.So 2nd url is fake.
Thus there are many features that are available which helps in determining phishing websites just by its URL.
